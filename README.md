# Principal-Component-analysis
"Throughout this work sample, I utilized deep learning techniques to experiment with a random dataset, and applied a variety of models. Additionally, I conducted a principal component analysis to check how many components should be taken during dimension reduction method and evaluated the performance of the models."
